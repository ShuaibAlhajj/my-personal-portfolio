**Learning:** Found that using placeholder-only inputs and non-semantic div elements for interactive controls (like menu toggles) creates significant accessibility barriers. Semantic HTML (labels, buttons) and ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls) are essential for a robust UX.
**Action:** Always prioritize semantic elements (e.g., <button> over <div> for clickable actions) and ensure every form input has a corresponding <label> for better accessibility and larger click targets.
